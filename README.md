## Relational Algebra Exercises
This is exercises for relational algebra in [the introduction to database course](https://class2go.stanford.edu/db/Winter2013) held by Stanford. It also includes related exercises from the [Database Systems: The Complete Book](http://www.amazon.com/Database-Systems-Complete-Edition-ebook/dp/B004XJIVIC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1358827547&sr=8-2&keywords=database+system+complete+book).

It used the [`ra`](http://www.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/ra/) to write relational algebra expressions.

## How to Run
- Follow the steps to install `ra`.
- Put the executive `ra` to your `$HOME/bin` and **remember to edit the path to find `ra.jar` in your system.**
- into each individual exercises, run `ra` to get the ra REPL to the database environment.
- run `ra -i q1.ra` to run particular algebra and see the result.
